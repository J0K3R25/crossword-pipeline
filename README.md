# crossword-pipeline
A prototype pipeline connecting an automatic crossword parser to an automatic crossword solver.


The relevant code is in main.py. To run the code entirely, you must first set the Berkeley Crossword Solver up. Otherwise, you can skip the solving part and convert the parsed crossword to JSON.
